Christian Frisson is an associate researcher at the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL) (2021), previously postdoctoral researcher at McGill University with the IDMIL (2019-2020), at the University of Calgary with the Interactions Lab (2017-2018) and at Inria in France with the Mjolnir team (2016-2017). He obtained his PhD at the University of Mons, numediart Institute, in Belgium (2015); his MSc in “Art, Science, Technology” from Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble with the Association for the Creation and Research on Expression Tools (ACROE), in France (2006); his Masters in Electrical (Metrology) and Mechanical (Acoustics) Engineering from ENSIM in Le Mans, France (2005).

Christian Frisson is a researcher in Human-Computer Interaction, with expertise in Information Visualization, Multimedia Information Retrieval, and Tangible/Haptic Interaction. Christian creates and evaluates user interfaces for manipulating multimedia data. Christian favors obtaining replicable, reusable and sustainable results through open-source software, open hardware and open datasets.

With his co-authors, Christian obtained the IEEE VIS 2019 Infovis Best Paper award and was selected among 4 finalists for IEEE Haptics Symposium 2020 Most Promising WIP.

Jun Nishida is **Currently** Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Chicago & Research Fellow at Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS PDRA) / **Previously** JSPS Research Fellow (DC1), Project Researcher at Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, SCOPE Innovation Program & PhD Fellow at Microsoft Research Asia / Graduated from Empowerment Informatics Program, University of Tsukuba, Japan. 

I’m a postdoctoral fellow at University of Chicago. I have received my PhD in Human Informatics at University of Tsukuba, Japan in 2019. I am interested in designing experiences in which all people can maximize and share their physical and cognitive capabilities to support each other. I explore the possibility of this interaction in the field of rehabilitation, education, and design. To this end, I design wearable cybernic interfaces which share one’s embodied and social perspectives among people by means of electrical muscle stimulation, exoskeletons, virtual/augmented reality systems. Received more than 40 awards including Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship Award, national grants, and three University Presidential Awards. Review service at ACM SIGCHI, SIGGRAPH, UIST, TEI, IEEE VR, HRI.

Heather Culbertson is a Gabilan Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Her research focuses on the design and control of haptic devices and rendering systems, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. Particularly she is interested in creating haptic interactions that are natural and realistically mimic the touch sensations experienced during interactions with the physical world. Previously, she was a research scientist in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University where she worked in the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab. She received her PhD in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM) at the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 working in the Haptics Group, part of the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory. She completed a Masters in MEAM at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, and earned a BS degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno in 2010. She is currently serving as the Vice-Chair for Information Dissemination for the IEEE Technical Committee on Haptics. Her awards include a citation for meritorious service as a reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Haptics, Best Paper at UIST 2017, and the Best Hands-On Demonstration Award at IEEE World Haptics 2013.
